# Beginner Coding Workshop

This project was made after I was asked by Kimberly Collins of Techlahoma to make a simple site for their OKC Workshop. I used simple HTML/CSS3 to create this site to allow it to also be used as a sample for teaching about web development. It is now currently kept up to date and updated by Kimberly.
